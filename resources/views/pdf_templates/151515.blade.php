        <p>Re: Flat Fee Retainer Aggrement</p>
        <p>Dear {{ $first_name }} {{ $last_name }}:</p>

        <p>This Agreement confirms that you are retaining Debt Freedom Attorneys PLLC, (“DFA” or “Firm”) to represent you in connection with disputes you have with your creditors who are identified on the attached <strong> <u>Addendum, Schedule 1</u></strong> of Enrolled Accounts. DFA’s Legal Services with respect to the Enrolled Accounts are identified in the attached <strong><u>Schedule 2</u></strong>.</p>

        <p>We have agreed to the Flat Fees identified in the attached <strong><u>Schedule 3</u></strong> (“Flat Fee Schedule”). Please submit your initial Flat Legal Fee payment and the signed retainer when you are ready for us to begin our representation of you. DFA Flat Fees will be deemed earned by DFA when paid. Thereafter Flat Fees will be due in accordance with the timetable established in <strong><u>Schedule 3</u></strong>.</p>

        <p>If there is litigation as a result of your Creditors bringing a lawsuit against you, or if DFA files a lawsuit on your behalf against your Creditors, disbursements and out-of-pocket expenses are included as part of the Schedule 3 Flat Fee, and you will not incur any separate charges for those. You will not be charged for any DFA disbursements and DFA out-of-pocket expenses including, by way of example: court filing fees, service of process fees, overnight mail charges, expert witness review and testimony, photocopying charges, messenger service, and other incidental fees..</p>

        <p>We understand that we will serve as legal counsel if a lawsuit is filed or defended against in New York. If a lawsuit is filed or defended outside of New York, DFA will refer the matter to a DFA Attorney who is licensed to practice in that state. The Terms of this Engagement will be the terms stated herein.</p>

        <p>There have been and can be no representations or guarantees made by us regarding the outcome of the DFA Legal Services. However, we do pledge to use our best efforts on your behalf.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p>We are bound by rules of professional conduct to protect the confidentiality of client information. As such, we do not disclose to third parties confidential information, including personal financial information, which we learn during the course of our representation of clients other than as permitted or required by law or by the rules of professional conduct.</p>
        <p>We retain records relating to professional services that we provide so that we are better able to assist you with your professional needs and, in some cases, to comply with the rules of professional conduct. We maintain safeguards to protect any personal financial information which we may receive.</p>
        <p>We do not anticipate having any disagreement with you about the quality, costs or appropriateness of our services, but if any concerns about these matters arise, please notify us immediately. We will endeavor to resolve any disagreements in a fair and amicable manner.
        </p>
        <p>If for some reason we are not able to resolve any such dispute ourselves, you may seek to resolve the dispute by the fee arbitration procedures provided in Part 137 of the Rules of the Chief Administrator of the Courts (22 NYCRR), a copy of which will be provided to you upon request.</p>
        <p>If this letter and the attachments attached hereto and referred to herein accurately reflect your understanding of the terms of this engagement, please return a signed copy of this letter to us and initial Flat Legal Fee payment as aforesaid, so that we may begin work. In the event a signed copy of this letter of engagement and initial Flat Legal Fee payment and $650 (six hundred fifty)  pre-existing litigation pre-engaging fee, if applicable, are both not received as promised, this offer to represent you shall automatically terminate.</p>
        <p>We sincerely look forward to working with you on this matter</p>

        <h2>Addendum to DFA Engagement Letter</h2>
        <h2>Schedule 1 - Enrolled Accounts</h2>
        <div></div>

        <h2>Schedule 2 - DFA Legal Services</h2>
        <p>
            DFA’s Legal Services will be provided by DFA Attorneys and include the following: Communicate with your Creditors and Debt Collectors to cease and desist from contacting and harassing you in connection with any of the Debts identified on the annexed <strong>Schedule 1</strong> 
            of Debts (“Enrolled Accounts”); Dispute the validity your Debts based upon information
            you provide the Firm; Address erroneous or inaccurate information regarding your Debts;
            Defend any lawsuit filed against you filed because of your Debts; Defend you against Debt
            collection or lawsuit; Initiate legal action in a court of competent jurisdiction against any
            creditor that violates any state or federal law in connection with any debt identified below;
            and Discuss whether Bankruptcy is an option for you and if so refer to you a non-DFA
            Bankruptcy Attorney; In connection with the Legal Services, DFA will not settle or
            compromise any matter without your consent. The DFA Legal Services provided to you with
            respect to your Creditors are provided in accordance with and are governed by various laws
            including the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. If you need to defend a lawsuit outside of
            New York, DFA will refer that matter to a DFA Attorney located in the relevant jurisdiction as
            Local Counsel and you authorize DFA to do that. You understand that while DFA Legal
            Services are being provided, your failure to pay debts as they become due will adversely
            affect your credit score and you will likely continue to incur late fees and penalties on the
            accounts during the period of DFA’s representation of you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where appropriate, DFA will use existing laws and communicate with creditors and credit
            bureaus on your behalf to attempt to invalidate your debts. DFA will also communicate with
            collection agencies, as applicable, to attempt to invalidate your debts by requiring collection
            agencies to supply their alleged evidence of your indebtedness to them, or through any
            other legal means. DFA will also investigate your “delinquent” accounts to determine the
            most effective method for invalidating your debts or otherwise removing any legal liability for
            such debts, up to and including the initiation of lawsuits on your behalf against your creditors
            and their third-party debt collectors.            
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p>
            In addition, if a lawsuit is filed against you, a DFA Attorney will represent you in such a
            lawsuit and will not charge any additional fees for such representation provided such a
            lawsuit was initiated after the date you sign this Agreement and after at least one payment
            to DFA has been made in accordance with <strong>Schedule 3</strong> attached hereto. In the event a
            lawsuit was initiated against you before the date you executed this Agreement, and you
            elect to have a DFA represent you, an additional fee of $650.00 will be charged. If legal fees
            are ordered by a Court to be recovered from a Creditor or a party adverse to you, DFA will
            retain such fees for its services. You will be responsible to pay any damages obtained by
            your Creditor resulting from any lawsuit filed against you. DFA’s Legal Fees incurred in
            defending a lawsuit on your behalf will be paid by DFA out of the fees set forth in <strong>Schedule 3</strong>, 
            including the fees of any Attorney retained on your behalf outside of New York, in a
            jurisdiction in which DFA New York Attorneys are not admitted to practice law. No additional
            payment from you to DFA will be necessary for the defense of any lawsuit filed against you
            after the date you execute this Agreement and after at least one payment to DFA has been
            made in accordance with <strong>Schedule 3</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>Legal Services not included in DFA Engagement</h2>
        <p>
            DFA Legal Services do not include as part of its representation of you, include any of the
            following services: (i) tax, financial planning, or accounting advice; (ii) modification,
            collection, or improvement of your credit reports or credit score, (iii) bankruptcy services, (iv)
            except as provided for herein, representation in any matter before any court or arbitration
            hearing, including but not limited to foreclosure proceedings; (v) guarantee elimination of
            harassment or collection calls from credits or collectors; although we will do our best to
            cause them to be ceased; (vi) debts secured by real or personal property.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you enroll any debt that is legally deemed “secured” (which is subject to and governed by
            a security interest in your real or personal property, such as a car loan wherein a lender has
            a right to repossess the vehicle or other secured item, you are prepared and understand
            that the item may be repossessed or you may otherwise lose possession of the item while
            DFA works its process to challenge and dispute the underlying debt.
        </p>
        <p>DFA is not a debt settlement or credit repair organization</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <h2>Schedule 3 - DFA Fees</h2>
        <p>You will pay the fees set forth below for the legal services provided by DFA. No fee or other
            cost will be charged or collected beyond the Flat Fee set forth below (or the $650 charge for
            a lawsuit which was initiated prior to your signing this Agreement). This is the only amount
            that you must pay to DFA for its services, and this Flat Fee is deemed earned when
            received by DFA. This fee does not, however, include any settlement that you may have to
            pay to any creditor if you opt to settle a debt prior to or during the course of a lawsuit.</p>

            represent that to be true to the best of your understanding and belief. DFA is under no
            obligation to verify and will not verify the information supplied by you to DFA. You will

            accurate information regarding such contacts; (iii) you will timely respond to all requests,
            communications or documentation from DFA, DFA Attorneys or DFA Legal Support

            <p>You expressly understand and agree that communication with DFA and any agent (including
                counsel) engaged by DFA to act on your behalf is of paramount importance. Proper
                representation and service cannot be provided if you cease or fail to communicate with DFA
                or its agent(s). If DFA attempts to contact you and is unsuccessful because you do not
                answer, return calls, or respond to communication, you understand and acknowledge that
                such (in)action can have significant consequences, including potential judgments or
                garnishments. In such a case, DFA reserves the right to cease representing you and to
                terminate this Agreement, in accordance with relevant laws, court obligations and ethical
                considerations
